1. account for dependabot's naming being different across repos. it shouldn't have to match the full name, just a substring
split on bump and from, ensure that the package name and final version

2. track how many PRs we have done and how many are left
3. refine the ux a little to make important alerts more visible
4. maintain the blacklist/whitelist on disk storage so we don't have to sall the same ones every setTimeout
5. Add a flag to ignore the blacklist on a given run
